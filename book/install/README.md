# Installation
-->

<!--
We have come a long way without installing anything! We learned **The Elm Architecture**. We learned about **types**. We learned how to interact with the outside world through **commands** and **subscriptions**. Things are going well, but we need to get Elm working on your computer for the next couple sections!
-->
Command: コマンド
Subscription: サブスクリプション
section: 節
The Elm Architecture: The Elm Architecture

<!--
The next two pages will show how to get Elm working in your **editor** and then in your **terminal**.
-->

<!--
**Why?** Upcoming topics like "JavaScript Interop" work a lot better when you can save files locally on your computer. This will also set us up to create more complex personal projects!
-->
interop: 相互運用

<!--
**Troubleshooting:** Things can sometimes go wrong with installation, so if you run into any trouble, please ask about it in a [community forum](https://elm-lang.org/community)! Talking through an install problem can usually save you a lot of time, and people are happy to help out. Please ask for help!
